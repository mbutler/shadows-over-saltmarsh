# FVTT-Simple-Experience-5e

Adjusts the xp thresholds in the dnd5e system to match the "5e Simple XP" system: <https://www.reddit.com/r/DnD/comments/3aduq2/5e_alternative_xp_system_5e_simple_xp_xpost_from/>

Probably doesn't play nicely with modules that would apply XP, and doesn't adjust monster XP value.
